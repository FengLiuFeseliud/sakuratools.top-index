For example, the CSS language definition\n\t\t\t * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded\n\t\t\t * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the\n\t\t\t * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do\n\t\t\t * this:\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ```js\n\t\t\t * Prism.languages.markup.style = {\n\t\t\t *     // token\n\t\t\t * };\n\t\t\t * ```\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens\n\t\t\t * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ```js\n\t\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'cdata', {\n\t\t\t *     'style': {\n\t\t\t *         // token\n\t\t\t *     }\n\t\t\t * });\n\t\t\t * ```\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ## Special cases\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`'s grammar\n\t\t\t * will be ignored.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ```js\n\t\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', {\n\t\t\t *     'comment': Prism.languages.markup.comment,\n\t\t\t *     // tokens after 'comment'\n\t\t\t * });\n\t\t\t * ```\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ## Limitations\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object\n\t\t\t * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave\n\t\t\t * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can't be implemented by temporarily\n\t\t\t * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn't actually insert the given tokens into the target object.\n\t\t\t * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This\n\t\t\t * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced. I.e. if\n\t\t\t * you hold the target object in a variable, then the value of the variable will not change.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ```js\n\t\t\t * var oldMarkup = Prism.languages.markup;\n\t\t\t * var newMarkup = Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', { ... });\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * assert(oldMarkup !== Prism.languages.markup);\n\t\t\t * assert(newMarkup === Prism.languages.markup);\n\t\t\t * ```\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * @param {string} inside The property of `root` (e.g. a language id in `Prism.languages`) that contains the\n\t\t\t * object to be modified.\n\t\t\t * @param {string} before The key to insert before.\n\t\t\t * @param {Grammar} insert An object containing the key-value pairs to be inserted.\n\t\t\t * @param {Object<string, any>} [root] The object containing `inside`, i.e. the object that contains the\n\t\t\t * object to be modified.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * Defaults to `Prism.languages`.\n\t\t\t * @returns {Grammar} The new grammar object.\n\t\t\t * @public\n\t\t\t */\n\t\t\tinsertBefore: function (inside, before, insert, root) {\n\t\t\t\troot = root || /** @type {any} */ (_.languages);\n\t\t\t\tvar grammar = root[inside];\n\t\t\t\t/** @type {Grammar} */\n\t\t\t\tvar ret = {};\n\n\t\t\t\tfor (var token in grammar) {\n\t\t\t\t\tif (grammar.hasOwnProperty(token)) {\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (token == before) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (var newToken in insert) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (insert.hasOwnProperty(newToken)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tret[newToken] = insert[newToken];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// Do not insert token which also occur in insert.
